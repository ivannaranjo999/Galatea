# ðŸ“” Galatea - Open Source Task Manager
## What is Galatea?
Galatea is a lightweight and efficient command-line task manager application
designed for users who prefer managing tasks directly from the terminal. It
provides essential task management features with minimal overhead, making it
ideal for developers.

## Features
- Add, edit, mark as done and delete tasks via simple commands.
- Assign priorities and deadlines to tasks.
- Two modes of operation:
  - CLI Mode: Use commands like `galatea add "Task description"` for quick task management and automation.
  - TUI Mode: Run `galatea` without any argument to access an interactive terminal interface with keyboard controls.
- Store task data in `~/.config/galatea/galatea-tasks.txt`, keeping your workspace clean.
- Implemented in C with minimal dependencies, requiring only `ncurses` for the text-based user interface.
